# HashMaps-SeparateChaining---DoubleHashing

### Pair Class :  
I have created this class to store the key of <String, String> form. I have also implemented a method called “toString()” which converts my key to a string containing first name and last name of the key and it returns the combination along with a space bar between the two. 
### Student class: 
I have created a student class of type String which implements the Student_ interface of type String. I have implemented all the methods of the Student_ interface and also I have overridden a method “toString()” in it which returns the combination of the first name and last name of the student along with a space bar between the two.
